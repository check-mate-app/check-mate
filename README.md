# Todo-List

## Requirements
You will need node.js, npm and polymer-cli (only front-end) for this application to run.

### Front-End
Skip this if you don't need to see the front-end.

Install Polymer CLI: `npm install -g polymer-cli`.
Install Bower: `npm install -g bower`.

## Install
To install, simply open the `Todolist/`-Folder in the command line (or power shell) and type `npm install`.

### Front-End
Go to `Todolist/WebClient/` and run `bower install`. You are now ready to build the frontend.

## Run
In the `Todolist/`-Folder, run `npm run dev`.

### Front-End
Go to `Todolist/WebClient/` and run `polymer build`. You are now ready to run the server (see above) and view the frontend.
