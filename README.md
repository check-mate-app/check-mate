## Requirements
You will need node.js, npm and polymer-cli (only front-end) for this application to run.

Skip this if you don't need to see the front-end.

Install Polymer CLI: `npm install -g polymer-cli`.

To install, simply open the `Todolist/`-Folder in the command line (or power shell) and type `npm install`.

### Front-End
Go to `Todolist/WebClient/` and run `bower install`. You are now ready to run.

## Run
